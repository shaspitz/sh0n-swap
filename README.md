# Sh0n Swap
An ERC20 token implementation, simple token exchange contract, and corresponding web UI. Really just a sandbox to experiment with Ethereum development. 

## Technologies
Solidity, Javascript, React/CSS/HTML, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Truffle/Ganache, Metamask interaction.  

Note that Solidity tests use Web3.js for executing contract functions, while front-end uses Ethers.js. During development for this project, I found the latter package to be preferable. Future projects of mine will use Ethers.js with Hardhat for testing and deployment.
